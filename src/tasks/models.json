It was the largest language model trained, as of 2020, with over 5 billion parameters and a dataset of 300 billion tokens. It is the successor to GPT-2 and the first large language model to showcase the ability to do in-context learning. GPT-3 was introduced in the paper Language Models are Few-Shot Learners, which demonstrated its natural language processing capabilities across various tasks without fine-tuning."

It is a transformer language model trained to act as a chatbot that was announced weeks after ChatGPT. It is a rival to ChatGPT that claims to have better natural language processing capabilities and safety features. It uses a technique called Constitutional AI, which aims to align the chatbot with human values by providing a principle-based approach.
