I want to get 0-3 keywords for some tasks from their task definition.
I'm planning on doing some augmentation, so I want to pick a small number of keywords that I will required to be mentioned in each new augmentation.
If the task specifies the possible answers, add those as keywords.
I'll give you some examples, and then you can help me with the last task definition. 

Task definition: 'In this task, you are given a country name and you need to return the calling code of the given country. Your output must be formatted as a plus sign (+), followed by the calling code number'
- country
- calling

Task definition: 'Given an adjective, generate its antonym. An antonym of a word is a word opposite in meaning to it.'
- antonym
- adjective

Task definition: 'In this task, you need to identify the sentiment of the given sentence as one of 'positive' or 'negative.'
- sentiment
- positive
- negative

Task definition: '{task_definition}'

Remember, you need to return the keywords, each on one bulleted line. Remember, only pick important crucial words. If there are only zero or one, that's ok!
