No law bans \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in Germany, but the government of Bavaria, holds the copyright and guards it ferociously. (Thomas Peter/REUTERS)\n\nThe city that was the center of Adolf Hitler\u2019s empire is littered with reminders of the Nazi past, from the bullet holes that pit the fronts of many buildings to the hulking Luftwaffe headquarters that now house the Finance Ministry.\n\nWhat it doesn\u2019t have, nor has it since 1945, are copies of Hitler\u2019s autobiography and political manifesto, \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d in its bookstores. The latest attempt to publish excerpts fizzled this week after the Bavarian government challenged it in court, although an expurgated copy appeared at newspaper kiosks around the country.\n\nBut in Germany \u2014 where keeping a tight lid on Hitler\u2019s writings has become a rich tradition in itself \u2014 attitudes toward his book are slowly changing, and fewer people are objecting to its becoming more widely available.\n\nNo law bans \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in Germany, but the government of Bavaria, where Hitler officially resided at the time of his 1945 suicide, holds the copyright and guards it ferociously. German-language copies that were printed before 1945 are legal, although they command a premium price, and the book is available in translation elsewhere in the world.\n\nBut the question of whether to publish it in the country where Hitler plotted his empire has lost some of its edge in the Google era, when a complete German-language copy of the book pops up as the second result on the local version of the search engine.\n\n\u201cTo say this is a very dangerous book, we must ban it, this is ridiculous,\u201d said Wolfgang Wippermann, a professor of modern history at the Free University of Berlin. \u201cMaybe it was necessary once, but now it\u2019s over, it makes no sense. You can find it so easily.\u201d\n\nThe publisher of the excerpts, London-based Albertus, has said it will appeal the Bavarian government\u2019s injunction. In 2009, the publisher beat charges of copyright violation and the illegal use of Nazi symbols after the Bavarian government seized reprinted copies of the Nazi Party\u2019s in-house newspaper.\n\nThe attempt to publish portions of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d on Thursday was scuttled at the last moment, although the publisher, ready to capitalize on the publicity, had printed two versions of the pamphlet. The version propped on top of a heap of celebrity magazines at a newsstand in Berlin\u2019s central Friedrichstrasse station was a slender, blue, 16-page leaflet that has historical commentary in one column and an image of blurred text stamped with \u201cUnreadable\u201d in the other, accompanied by two reproductions of Nazi-era newspapers.\n\n\u201cMein Kampf\u201d \u201cis an awful book, and the whole thinking is absolutely not ours, but we have another view on it regarding the idea of packing it away. This idea is just naive,\u201d said Alexander Luckow, a spokesman for the publisher. \u201cIn a free country, you need to discuss these very bad parts of German history.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, there are limits, and using Hitler\u2019s words as inspiration, not as historical artifact, is where it crosses the line.\n\n\u201cThe danger is allowing right-wing people to sell it in bookshops with their modern commentary,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is forbidden and it\u2019s good . . . not only in Germany, this should be equal in other countries in Europe. Anti-Semitism is not confined to Germany. You look and it\u2019s all around Europe, dating back to the Middle Ages.\u201d\n\nThe debate will soon be over, whether or not the latest excerpts make it to newsstands. German law extends copyright 70 years after the author\u2019s death; after 2015, \u201cMein Kampf\u201d will be fair game. Some in Bavaria\u2019s government worry that neo-Nazis will publish their own version of the book shortly thereafter, and to counter that, they are encouraging a scholarly edition. A group of historians is preparing it.\n\nGermany\u2019s Jewish organizations have approached the publication with mixed emotions, sensitive that their country still has problems with neo-Nazis and anti-Semitism. The German government released a study this week that found that one in five Germans has anti-Semitic attitudes. And a neo-Nazi ring that has been linked to at least nine killings before it was shut down in November shocked Germans who thought they had done a thorough job working through their past.\n\n\u201cI do very well without any publishing of \u2018Mein Kampf,\u2019 \u201d said Dieter Graumann, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. \u201cIn a few years, it will be free, and I have every trust in the democratic maturity of the German people. . . .

{"prompt": "", "completion": "For today\u2019s post, I\u2019d like to take a look at California\u2019s voter initiative to legalize pot. If the measure passes, and the sky doesn\u2019t fall, many other states will probably be looking at similar law changes in the near future. Our drug policy of the last century has simply not worked, and it\u2019s heartening to see a state attempting to legalize marijuana.\n\nThe statistics on marijuana arrests are really shocking. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, which is in favor of legalization, blacks are arrested for marijuana possession between four and twelve times more than whites in California, even though studies have consistently shown that whites smoke more pot than blacks. In the last ten years, around 500,000 people have been arrested for possession. That\u2019s absurd! Think about how expensive that is for the criminal justice system. California spends $216,000 for each juvenile inmate in its prison system, yet it spends only $8,000 per student in the Oakland school system. It seems to me that if you really want to limit drug use, it\u2019d make more sense to spend more money keeping kids in school, helping them achieve.\n\nThe economic benefits of legalizing marijuana are mind blowing. If marijuana was legalized and taxed at the same rate of tobacco, the money we would save on law enforcement and gain in tax revenue equals about $17 billion. As Nicholas Kristof notes, that is enough money to send every three and four year old in a poor neighborhood to pre-school. Or we could spend that money improving public school education. Or we could use the money to shore up border defense. Whatever we do, $17 billion is not exactly a trivial amount.\n\nFor me, the biggest reason to legalize marijuana is to hurt the cartels. Immigration has emerged as a hot button issue recently, with Arizona passing a draconian immigration law and many similar propositions being considered by other states. People are worried about violence, and understandably so. No one wants to have foreign drug dealers operating in their back yard. But no matter how many laws we pass, or how much money we spend, marijuana from Mexico and other Latin American countries will always find a way across the border. Drug importers are smart, and the demand is so high that increased patrols by border agents and harsher prison sentences will not act as an effective deterrent. America will always have a demand for marijuana, and that means as long as the drug stays illegal, violent drug cartels will operate in our borders.\n\nBut what if the drug that the cartels are pushing is suddenly legal? No one in their right mind would buy pot off the street if they could instead walk into a dispensary and buy high quality marijuana legally, and probably for less money than the cartels are charging. Very few people actually want to have to hide their drug use. If given a choice, marijuana smokers would absolutely buy legal drugs. This would severely weaken the cartels, and decrease deaths related to drug trafficking.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating drug use here. I know people who have ruined their lives from excess drug use. But it\u2019s not true that marijuana is the gateway drug that people have been demonizing for years. Just because someone smokes pot every once in a while doesn\u2019t mean that person will turn around and become a heroin addict. Yes, marijuana intoxicates you, but so do legal drugs like alcohol. As long as sensible restrictions are built into the law, such as making it illegal to drive under the influence, then there is no reason that marijuana should not be legalized."}

During the clashes one policeman was injured and five protesters were arrested on criminal charges. After the end of the clashes, a local greek father, Mr Tasoulas, defying the reign of terror in the area, took his son to play in the coveted playground. Soon they were surrounded by fascists who blocked the exit of the playground and threatened to linch the father calling him a traitor. After he managed to handle the child to a sympathetic neighbor, the fascists beat the father in full presence of the chief of the local police station. The strong police forces present at the scene then arrested the father and took him to the local police station, where his solicitor, a leading figure of the legal world and human rights activist, was piled with eggs by fascists who threatened her life.\n\nThe new tension in the area comes after the euroelection ascent of LAOS, the fascist Popular Orthodox Alarm Party, to the 4th position with 7% of the vote. This in combination with the governing party's landslide defeat, has led the government to endorse the core of the extreme-right wing policies of LAOS, and pledge a mass sweeping operation against illegal immigrants and their greek supporters within the summer. As the concentration camp planned to be built in the old NATO airbase of Aspropyrgos is now deemed impractical, the government has committed several old military camps of disgraceful humanitarian standards around the capital for the purpose of \"cleaning the city of foreigners\". The measures and discourse comes as little surprise as it comes from a political party famous for wanting to displace homosexuals in desert islands in the late 1970s. Furthermore the \"Law and Order\" operation of the coming summer is said to also include a mass attack against anarchist squats, and solidarity actions to immigrants by the movement as a whole. This the government hopes to achieve via a virtual military occupation of the center of Athens for the summer months modeled on Olympics 2004, as well as the introduction of a disputed legislation that would eventually render protest marches illegal. Due to the lack of a legislative majority by one MP, the government has resorted to yet another legal trick by increasing the total number of MPs by one, non-elected member of its own liking for the summer session of the Parliament.\n\nThe dictatorial rule of the right-wing and the ruthless employment of its parastate agents is increasing the tension across the country. Last week one police station in Athens was attacked and a central tax office was bombed by a Marxist guerrilla group, while a series of luxury brothels frequented by the ruling class were destroyed. At the same time, the movement is on its guard in expectation of next Saturday's Gay Pride parade which last year was attacked by parastate fascist thugs, as well as in expectation of an evacuation of the old courts in down-town Athens which are occupied by immigrants and are a constant target by the bourgeois media who waste no time in supporting the fascists in a most unambiguous manner."}

Half a century ago, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote that right-wing thought had come to be dominated by the belief that Communist agents had infiltrated all levels of American government and society. The right, he explained, had identified a \u201csustained conspiracy, running over more than a generation, and reaching its climax in Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, to undermine free capitalism, to bring the economy under the direction of the federal government, and to pave the way for socialism or communism.\u201d In a 2009 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that the anti-government militia movement \u2014 which had risen to prominence during the Clinton administration and faded away during the Bush years \u2014 has returned. According to the SPLC, the anti-government resurgence has been buttressed by paranoid rhetoric from public officials like Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann and media figures like Fox News\u2019 Glenn Beck. Just last month, Gregory Giusti pleaded guilty to repeatedly threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 including threatening to destroy her California home \u2014 because he was \u201cupset with her passing the health care law.\u201d His mother told a local news station that he \u201cfrequently gets in with a group of people that have really radical ideas,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019d say Fox News or all of those that are really radical, and he \u2014 that\u2019s where he comes from.\u201d After the 2008 election, Fox News personalities filled the airwaves with increasingly violent rhetoric and apocalyptic language. On his Fox News show, Beck talked about \u201cput[ting] poison\u201d in Pelosi\u2019s wine.\n\nObservers of this most recent act were mystified by one of Byron Williams\u2019 reported targets: the Tides Foundation, a low-profile charitable organization known for funding environmentalists, community groups, and other organizations. Beck, it turned out, had attacked Tides 29 times on his Fox News show in the year-and-a-half leading up to the shooting.\n\nIn their writeup, The Huffington Post provided a video that detailed Williams\u2019 attack, as posted on YouTube.

Let\u2019s absorb that disturbing fact \u2013 right now, Britain\u2019s poor children are more than twice as likely to be obese or overweight.\n\nResponses to these statistics have included calls for a ban on junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed, but is this really the most productive way forward?\n\nWhat if it\u2019s not so much about \u201cjunk food\u201d, as we define it, but, rather, that all too often these days the junk is the food and the food is the junk \u2013 and that sometimes, for people on tight budgets, this is all that\u2019s reasonably achievable?\n\nOnce poverty enters the equation, it\u2019s simply not about junk food as we understand it anymore. Say junk food and an image springs to mind of people allowing their children to scarf down crisps, sweets, and the now notorious fizzy drinks, or burgers, pizzas and fried chicken from overflowing buckets. The implication is that the problem lies with the treats and extras, consumed on top of real meals and that children are being overindulged, to the detriment of their health.\n\nHowever, this image of feckless, uncaring, underprivileged Britons encouraging their fat children to over-snack simply doesn\u2019t ring true, especially considering that these are households where, by definition, money is tight.\n\nOn the contrary, it seems obvious that the actual meals are contributing hugely to the problem \u2013 and that this is where austerity is having a terrifying and sustained impact.\n\nWhile healthy food is often prohibitively expensive, less healthy options are relatively as cheap as, well, chips. When parents have to find the cheapest food available for their family, it\u2019s nearly always going to be less likely to be fresh; more likely to be highly calorific (therefore \u201cfilling\u201d), as well as packed with additives whose addictive and metabolism-skewing properties should not be discounted.\n\nYou also have to factor in how exhausting poverty is. Often the last thing that stressed, skint parents need at the end of the day is to start a meal from scratch.\n\nThis is why, however well meant, the \u201cwhy not buy some veg from the local market and make a lovely stew?\u201d rationale so often takes on the shrill ring of Marie Antoinette\u2019s fabled suggestion about the poor eating cake.\n\nThat\u2019s the cruel thing about cooking. It\u2019s not all about \u201clazy proles\u201d and their lost culinary skills. Something that\u2019s a hobby, a stress release, in an affluent household, too easily becomes an extra source of tension in an impoverished one. Moreover, \u201creal\u201d cooking can be expensive \u2013 from the ingredients, and the herbs and spices, to the equipment, even the gas or electricity. Hence the microwave, the ripping open of the packet, the easier solution. Who\u2019s to judge? Plenty of people do.\n\nPerhaps it could be acknowledged that the very concept of junk food has become absurdly dated and misleading. That shifts in fundamental food culture (the creep of junk into normal meals) appear to be a much more profound problem than merely overindulging in signposted treats. Kids eating rubbish has always been with us but it is only now that the staples, the dietary cornerstones, are also unhealthy, that their weight problems are escalating. Nor is the problem confined to junk food advertising \u2013 if only it were that simple. Like with most things that become uncontrollable in life, money lies at the core. Poverty isn\u2019t only exhausting and limiting, it\u2019s also highly fattening.\n\nCoe did the right thing. But why did it take so long?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Better late than never.

Is he on another planet or am I?\n\nCoe\u2019s resignation doesn\u2019t prove that there was any wrongdoing, even with the email that surfaced relating to Eugene (birthplace of Nike) winning the right to stage the 2012 World Athletics Championships without others being allowed to bid.

Nevertheless he has to stop this ludicrous sulking as if a big fuss is being made about nothing.\n\nThis is a prime example of a big fuss being made about\u2026 something.

(Oh sorry, I went a bit funny there.)\n\nHopkins wasn\u2019t banned from speaking. Instead, just as she began to talk, a large bunch of students stood up, turned their backs on her and walked out of the hall. It was an action that was widely billed as a wonderful compromise protest, but it wasn\u2019t really.\n\nOf course it was better than banning \u2013 but only because anything is better than banning. It wasn\u2019t spontaneous, and therefore looked staged and just a little pompous. Nor, crucially, did it respect one of the foremost principles of free speech.\n\nFree speech is not just about someone being allowed to talk, it is also about them being properly heard and debated, and this holds true, even when that someone is as idiotic and offensive as Hopkins. Especially then.\n\nFor free speech to work, you have to let people speak first, and then challenge them via debate, which means no bans or, indeed, back-turnings and walk-outs.\n\nOtherwise, all that happens is that people such as Hopkins remain wedded to the delusion that they\u2019re fearless speakers of truth. Ideally, they should have their arguments brusquely shredded in a public forum.\n\nThe Brunel University walk-out was not a compromise protest, it was just a way of banning without actually banning. Everyone has to stop panicking and just allow people to be annoying bigots. Last time that I checked, the good people of Britain could cope."}

For front-end, React/Anguar/Vue are capable of building middle-size or even large apps, with help of all kinds of components and libraries. Deploying webapps is never easier, Webpack has almost all the features we need. For backend, Node.js ecosystem has been evolving since 2009, we have Express and Koa, with all kinds of middlewares. No mention how many developers are participating in \u201crewriting everything in JavaScript\u201d.\n\nJavaScript is a messy world. Mixed language paradigms, inconsistent languages features, lots of innovations toward different and sometimes opposite directions. It\u2019s hard to get well with such an inconsistent programming language. However, it turned out people like to use it thanks to its successful ecosystem.\n\nClojureScript is in a different situation. We have faith in functional programming but there\u2019s not a large community to support it. Here\u2019s the problem in me. I want to build websites with only ClojureScript. How can I achieve that?\n\nFor front-end, ClojureScript libraries and components are relatively rare(or at least hard to find many of them on Google). Yes we can use use JavaScript libraries and components. However it\u2019s not always true. Take an example from React and Vue, which are both in JavaScript, but it\u2019s impractical to share components from each other. I saw people using React components in Reagent or Rum many times. I was convinced it\u2019s possible. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy since we may need so many components.\n\nFor backend it\u2019s worse. People are using Clojure to build web servers. Being a JavaScript developer there are lots of barriers if I want to pick up the whole Java ecosystem. Developing and debugging Clojure is a lot different from ClojureScript. And for web servers, the JavaScript community is throwing away expressing and going toward Koa with async/await support, while in ClojureScript it\u2019s core.async , a lot different. We can still Google and find blogs and projects on using React components in ClojureScript, but it\u2019s fewer results for Node.js, besides, how about the framework and libraries? And I\u2019m not sure about the database part either.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to believe in ClojureScript. To see JavaScript developers using create-react-app, using Koa, although slowly but most aspects of developing are covered by people who went ahead. In using ClojureScript, I have to take every step very carefully, sometimes in debugging without SourceMaps on variables, sometimes worried about where to find guides and docs, sometimes anxious about people misunderstanding my work.\n\nI will still pick ClojureScript as the primary language for my personal projects. Also I\u2019m fully aware that it adds limits to me so someday I still need to pick up some other languages to finish my work. It will be my big problem in the near future. I already see it and it made me feel sad that I can only write fast in ClojureScript. ClojureScript has some unique features that help me finished Stack Editor and Cumulo, but also trapped me here.

The interview will be broadcast at wsws.org/autoworkers/interview.\n\nThe battle by autoworkers in the United States has reached a critical juncture. After Fiat Chrysler workers overwhelmingly defeated the contract pushed by the United Auto Workers earlier this month, the UAW has brought back another deal crafted to meet the strategic aims of the auto corporations and Wall Street.\n\nNo matter what the spin the UAW\u2019s PR firm puts on it, the new deal, like the first, would accelerate the descent of autoworkers\u2014once among the highest-paid industrial workers in the world\u2014into the ranks of the working poor.\n\nThe challenges autoworkers face are immense, but the forces they can mobilize among workers and youth in the US and around the world are more powerful. To carry out a successful struggle, however, autoworkers who are leading this fight have to have a clear understanding of the economic and political forces that they confront.\n\nTo submit a question in advance of the interview, please register below.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Don\u2019t raise your voice here.\n\nAngela Kabari Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jul 20, 2017\n\nMy name is Angela. I am the woman in the centre of the current Ushahidi sexual harassment scandal.\n\nThe past six months have been some of the most bizarre in my life and, on the balance, I think there is benefit in sharing my experience with the world so that lessons may be learned from it. It is my hope that, my story shall prompt a change in company policies, both in the Kenyan tech space and in other fields.\n\nI joined Ushahidi in September 2015 as a Capacity Development Officer for Making All Voices Count. My time there was mostly enjoyable: the work was challenging, the team was great, and the environment was liberal and progressive. All in all, a good place to be. Of course, everything was not perfect, but what organisation does not have issues and day-to-day frictions?\n\nThis changed on the morning of January 19th 2017, when Daudi Were, the Executive Director at Ushahidi asked me to have sex with a colleague, presumably for his own titillation. The events of that night left me troubled and confused. I knew that what had happened to me was not right, but I thought it was an isolated incident and decided to forget it and attempted to move on. (For details of this, see here my statement on the events of the night as well as a transcript of the audio. Some of the names in the transcript have been altered to protect the identities of my former colleagues. Aside from this, no other alterations have been made to it).\n\nI managed to do this for precisely one week after which I began to lose focus on my work. Over the next two weeks, I started to experience migraines whenever I went to the office. I did not want to leave my bed, yet I was sleeping poorly. I had experienced some periodic stomach upsets prior to and during the team retreat. However, after the retreat, these became worse and more frequent. At first, I thought that this was due to the upheaval that the Making All Voices Count programme was experiencing at the time due to international politics (it was negatively impacted by Brexit and changes in US presidency).\n\nI also thought that I might be physically ill so I sought professional advice from my doctor. I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection of the gut, but my doctor could not account for all my other symptoms. Upon his advice, I went to see a therapist who suggested some exercises to help me figure out what was wrong. I also took 3 weeks off from work from late February to mid-March as I thought I might be suffering from ordinary stress and burnout.\n\nIt was during this time off that I did the exercises prescribed by the therapist and I realised that my problem was psychosomatic. The distress from the incident in January had caught up with me, almost a month later. I had tried to pass off Daudi\u2019s remarks as drunkenness or joking but my body wasn\u2019t buying it. It was at this point that I decided to quietly resign; I still wasn\u2019t convinced that it was something I could or should raise with my employers.\n\nOnce I had made this decision in early March, I separately confided in two close friends that I was looking for a new job because I was uncomfortable with continuing to work at Ushahidi. When they asked why I was leaving, I shared with them some details of what had happened with Daudi. In the course of our conversations, I was stunned to learn that Daudi\u2019s comments were not the isolated incident I had assumed but rather that he had a years\u2019 long, widely-known reputation for sexually inappropriate conduct, socially and at work.\n\nAfter my leave was over, I began predominantly working from home, which thankfully was possible as Ushahidi allows remote working. I was going to the office only thrice a month on average and I timed my visits to the office to ensure that I would not have to run into Daudi. It was in early April, after a month of soul searching and conversations with three other women who had been on the receiving end of unwelcome attention from Daudi, that I came to the conclusion that something needed to be done. Unfortunately, I seemed to be the only person with both tangible evidence of his misconduct, as well as an employer-employee relationship. It is then that I sought legal advice and learned that, based on the provisions of Ushahidi\u2019s HR Manual, as well as Kenyan and Florida Law, Daudi\u2019s comments qualified as sexual harassment by creating a hostile environment. I was advised that I could file a court case but that it would be prudent to first give the company an opportunity to address the issue internally as the court should be a last resort.\n\nWith this in mind, I began to reach out to some of the women I had spoken to earlier. At this stage, I had been able to identify over five women who had also had inappropriate encounters with Daudi. Only one woman was willing to come forward if the Board could guarantee that she would remain anonymous. Some of the other women had no evidence of their allegations and thus did not expect to be believed. Others did not want to be associated with something so potentially scandalous or to rehash past traumatic events. It therefore took about three more weeks to get my ducks in a row and submit the complaint to the board; I did that on 4th May 2017.\n\nSee this timeline for what transpired since.\n\nSince then, I have heard terrible stories from a total of eleven women who have told me about having similar unpleasant encounters with Daudi, in addition to another ten or so stories that I\u2019ve been unable to verify. The behaviour told of in these stories varies from inappropriate and/or suggestive text messages to sending of pictures of male genitalia and pornography. In one incident Daudi allegedly exposed his genitals to a woman in the middle of a conversation about her work.\n\nViewed against this grim picture, I feel as if I got off lightly. And, in the larger spectrum of harassment that encompasses physical assault and even sexual assault, it is easy to dismiss what happened to me as trivial. Except that it is not. I\u2019ve actually had people tell me \u201cIt was only words so it\u2019s not a big deal \u2014 at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d However, in my view, verbal harassment is not inconsequential; in addition to being traumatic, it is often the gateway to more grievous offences and thus should not be treated lightly or ignored.\n\nThe reason I did not come forward with my story earlier is because, under Kenyan law, it is not permitted to comment on matters currently before a court. In this case, I was advised that as a show of good faith I should uphold this convention and extend its application to the internal Ushahidi process, even though the convention does not apply because the internal process was not judicial. But now that the Ushahidi Board has suspended Daudi after finding him guilty of gross misconduct, and will issue him with a notice to show cause why his employment should not be terminated, I am of the view that I am finally free to speak and comment on this entire debacle.\n\nI have two main bones of contention. The first is Daudi\u2019s behaviour. Based on the additional allegations made via tweets and offline discussions that have occurred since the news of my complaint came to light on 9th July, it would not be a stretch to call Daudi\u2019s alleged behaviour predatory. Such predation is enabled by a culture of silence and secrecy that encourages victims of harassment to \u201cnot make a fuss\u201d or \u201cpersevere\u201d or \u201cjust ignore him until he gets tired or bored and goes away.\u201d This culture leads many, many victims to not call out predatory behaviour and report it as the violence it actually is. This culture feeds into the victims\u2019 fears that there is no point in speaking out against the harassment they face and leads them to feel like they have no option but to suffer in silence. This must stop! We cannot expect victims of harassment to speak up if they are (rightly) afraid that public opprobrium will follow.\n\nMy second bone of contention is the Board\u2019s response. I have been deeply let down by the actions and inaction of David Kobia, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich and Jenny Stefanotti. Ever since I lodged my complaint on 4th May, I have been subjected to all the negative repercussions that make victims of harassment afraid to speak out:\n\nLack of support: Over the 74 days of this ordeal, not a single board member has reached out to inquire about my well being in any way, shape or form. Not a phone call, not an email, not through a third party. I shall repeat this again: nobody from Ushahidi leadership or the board has at any point bothered to ask if I\u2019m okay or sought to alleviate the adverse impact this has had on my work and health. The only person in management who displayed any concern is my supervisor who, even though he is my direct line manager, only found out about this when I informed him of my intention to leave Ushahidi on 19th June. The Board have claimed on several occasions that they refrained from enquiring about my well-being because they feared incurring legal liability. To the best of my knowledge, no laws prohibit a person from asking \u201chow are you?\u201d Anyone possessing some basic human decency should know \u2014 and do \u2014 better. Victim shaming: All through this process, I have been subtly censured by the Board for seeking and retaining legal counsel.

(AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A., File)\n\nFacebook has finally forgotten about that drunken night in college when you vomited on that one friend who never talked to you again. Any deleted photo from that episode, or any photo deleted by users for whatever reason, has finally been removed from the social network's servers, it appears.\n\n(Now if only your friend could permanently forget about the incidence too.)\n\nSince 2009, Ars Technica's Jacqui Cheng has doggedly tracked how long it takes big photo-sharing sites to permanently delete photos after a user hits \"Delete.\" Her method was simple: save a photo's URL, delete the photo and wait to see how long it takes for the link to die. For Twitter and Flickr, it took seconds. For MySpace (remember that?), it took months. But for Facebook, Cheng found it could take years.\n\nIn some cases, photos deleted in 2009 were still on Facebook servers in 2012. In February, Facebook explained to Cheng \"[w]e have been working hard to move our photo storage to newer systems which do ensure photos are fully deleted.\" Now, Cheng is happy to report that she has \"tested this with two photos while saving their direct URLs, and both photos became inaccessible within two days of deletion.\" Her readers got similar results.\n\nFirst, let us say, Good job, Facebook. Like how we train a dog, we ought to reward good behavior as well as punish bad. The media, rolling up its newspaper, has knocked Facebook on the nose for many no-nos: swapping users' listed email addresses for Facebook addresses, accidentally showing people's private chats to the public, to name a few snafus. We're glad to finally give Facebook a treat.\n\nBut why did this take so long to implement?\n\n\"The systems we used for photo storage a few years ago did not always delete images from content delivery networks in a reasonable period of time even though they were immediately removed from the site,\" Facebook told Ars Technica on Thursday. During its period of massive growth, Facebook apparently found it difficult to expand its servers and delete photos in a timely fashion. But now that new photo storage, installed in February, apparently deletes photos within 30 days, according to Facebook.\n\nPerhaps what this tells us several months later is that Facebook wanted to get serious about privacy -- including making sure that unwanted photos weren't being stored after users tried to delete them -- as it hurtled toward its initial public offering in May.

He told Bloomberg TV that Republicans should back the president\u2019s use-of-force resolution and argued in a Washington Post op-ed that failure to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against his own people would damage U.S. credibility if military action were threatened over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nWhile Hadley\u2019s role in the Bush administration was always noted, there was no mention of his ties to Raytheon, manufacturer of Tomahawk cruise missiles, which likely would have been fired from Navy destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean in strikes against Syria. Hadley has been on the board of directors of Raytheon since 2009 and, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from June included in the new report, owned 11,477 shares of Raytheon stock, now worth about $875,000. Hadley was also paid $128,500 in cash compensation by the company last year, according to a filing with the SEC.\n\nIn one appearance, CNN noted that Hadley is a principal at RiceHadleyGates, an international strategic consulting firm based in Silicon Valley and Washington.\n\nFred Hiatt, editorial page editor at The Post, said Hadley\u2019s opinions in the newspaper\u2019s op-ed commentary were not colored by his association with Raytheon.\n\n\u201cMore disclosure is generally better than less, but I\u2019m confident that Hadley\u2019s opinion piece, which was consistent with the worldview he has espoused for many years, was not influenced by any hypothetical, certainly marginal, impact to Raytheon\u2019s bottom line,\u201d Hiatt said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson said Hadley was traveling in China and unavailable for comment.\n\nRetired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, a former commander of the U.S. Central Command, also made several media appearances to discuss the Syrian situation and cautioned that the kind of limited intervention that was being proposed has in the past been difficult to accomplish. But in the five appearances covered by the study, his ties to the defense industry were not disclosed.\n\nZinni has been on the board of directors of BAE Systems, a top defense contractor, since 2002 and was board chairman from 2009 to 2012. The company specializes in cybersecurity, intelligence analysis and several weapons systems. Zinni, in addition, sits on the board of advisers of DC Capital Partners, a private equity firm that focuses on investments in intelligence, homeland security and other sectors.\n\nReached by e-mail, Zinni said his board memberships are public. \u201cThe media who contact me for comment should post any relevant info re my background including my board positions if they desire,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRetired Gen. Jack Keane, a former Army vice chief of staff, made frequent appearances as well, including as a Fox News military analyst, during which he supported U.S. action against Syria. His military career and his affiliation with the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank where he is board chairman, were regularly cited.\n\nBut there was no disclosure of Keane\u2019s ties to General Dynamics, where he has been on the board since 2004, and to SCP Partners, a venture capital firm focused in part on investments in defense and security, where he is a venture partner. General Dynamics\u2019 Bath Iron Works is the lead designer and builder of the destroyers from which the Tomahawk missiles would have been launched. Keane\u2019s office said he was not available to comment.\n\nAsked about the report\u2019s findings, Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news at Fox News, said in a statement, \u201cWe generally disclose contacts when our judgment is that it\u2019s journalistically germane to the story.\u201d\n\nTwo other networks where analysts covered by the report made frequent appearances, CNN and NBC, did not respond to requests for comment."}

The electric shocks lessen the pain felt by animals when their throats are cut.\n\nA number of industry bodies have spoken out against the slaughtering of animals without pre-stunning, with the British Veterinary Association saying there is an 'unacceptable time lapse between slaughter and the onset of permanent insensibility [loss of feeling] when animals are not stunned'.\n\nAnimals must also be stunned before slaughter under EU regulations.\n\nHowever Britain allows an exemption for those who oppose because of religious beliefs and the number of animals killed without stunning appears to be on the rise.\n\nRITUAL KILLING OF ANIMALS FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS HALAL Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. KOSHER According to the laws, in order for a meat to kosher it must come from an animal that meets the kosher rules. These are the animal must be ruminant and have split hooves. Ruminant animals chew food once and swallow, before regurgitating it and chewing again. Animals that Jews can eat include cows, sheep, goats and deer. They cannot eat pigs despite the fact it has split hooves because it is not a ruminant animal. Before slaughtering, the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe, causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness. Jews believe this is a way of killing that shows 'respect and compassion' as set out in Jewish law.\n\nSome 2.4 million sheep and goats were put to death using the religious method in halal and kosher abattoirs in 2013 \u2013 a rise of 60 per cent on 2011.\n\nAccording to analysis by the Food Standards Agency, some 37 per cent of sheep and goats, 25 per cent of cattle and 16 per cent of poultry were killed in this way in halal premises.\n\nResearchers from the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Science questioned Islamic scholars and Halal consumers on the use of pre-slaughter stunning.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Meat Science.\n\nSome 69 per cent of scholars said they did not agree that stunning prior to slaughter had been showed to reduce the pain felt by animals, according to The Times.\n\nHowever more than 95 per cent of the scholars and 53 per cent of consumers agreed that if stunning did not result in death, cause physical injury or obstruct bleed-out, the meat would be considered Halal.\n\nThe study said: ' The lack of understanding of stunning among some scholars has resulted in the issuance of confusing fatwas on the suitability of stunned meat for consumption by Muslims.\n\n'There is an urgent need for these scholars to be given theoretical and practical education on stunning and other modern slaughter techniques such as mechanical slaughter.\n\n'This will help them make informed decisions about the suitability of these techniques for Halal production.'\n\nGudrun Ravetz, president of the British Veterinary Association said: 'Our view is that all animals should be stunned before slaughter, based on peer reviewed evidence that indicates an unacceptable time lapse between slaughter and the onset of permanent insensibility when animals are not stunned.\n\nBritain allows an exemption for those who oppose because of religious beliefs and the number of animals killed without stunning appears to be on the rise.

While mail-in ballots will only be counted on Monday, Van der Bellen\u2019s margin of victory was too great to change the outcome, and Hofer conceded defeat.\n\nVan der Bellen, 72, said that he stood for the \u201cold values\u201d of freedom, equality and solidarity. He also signaled that he wanted to preside over a more active presidency, urging a focus on policies such as efforts to tackle unemployment.\n\nAustria sent a \u201cgood signal\u201d today \u201cto the capitals of the European Union,\u201d Van der Bellen, who ran as an independent, said in an interview with public broadcaster ORF. \u201cYou can actually win elections with a pro-European position.\u201d\n\nTogether with a referendum in Italy also being held on Sunday, the Austrian vote was seen as a bellwether for populist sentiment in Europe after the U.K.\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election to the U.S. presidency. Geert Wilders, the anti-Islam Dutch politician, offered Hofer his commiserations on Twitter, as did French National Front leader Marine Le Pen. Nigel Farage, the former head of the U.K. Independence Party, had cited Hofer\u2019s EU-skeptic stance as further evidence of the pressures buffeting the EU \u201cconstruction.\u201d\n\nGerman Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who heads the Social Democratic Party, hailed Van der Bellen\u2019s win as a \u201cvictory of reason against right-wing populism,\u201d according to an interview with Bild newspaper. EU President Donald Tusk extended his \u201cwholehearted congratulations\u201d to Van der Bellen in an e-mailed statement.\n\nYear of Acrimony\n\nThe result defied projections of a razor-tight finish and ends an acrimonious year of campaign politics that polarized Austria. Van der Bellen, who pledged to prevent anti-EU forces from forming a government, now has to heal the rifts exposed over immigration and economic inequality.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in 70 years the country has elected a presidential candidate outside the Social Democratic or Austrian People\u2019s Party, after both the established parties were eliminated in earlier rounds of voting. It\u2019s also the first time that a Green Party leader has won a popular election in Europe to become head of state since the global environmental movement began.\n\nVan der Bellen narrowly squeezed out Hofer in the first presidential runoff on May 22, but the result was overturned by the Constitutional Court because of irregularities in counting mail-in ballots. Austria\u2019s Interior Ministry showed Van der Bellen won more rural support in Sunday\u2019s repeat vote, and also took key regions in the industrial heartland of Upper Austria as well as in the mountains of Tirol.\n\nOpening Doors\n\nThe result is a rebuff to some analysts who predicted Hofer would benefit from the same nationalist forces that propelled Trump to the presidency last month. Hofer campaigned on his ability to court favor inside a Trump White House as well as with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking my voters to accept that in a democracy, the voter is always right,\u201d said Hofer. He added that he\u2019s looking forward to the next round of national elections where he\u2019ll stand by Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache, who accused Van der Bellen of orchestrating Sunday\u2019s victory with a \u201cmassive campaign of fear.\u201d\n\nAustrian Chancellor Christian Kern, a Social Democrat who warned last week that the EU must reform or slip into the abyss, struck a more conciliatory tone.\n\n\u201cAlexander Van der Bellen will be a good partner for an open-minded, future-oriented policy of chances and hopes,\u201d Kern said. \u201cTo the voters of Norbert Hofer, I say nobody should feel like a loser today.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "The views may be pleasantly apocalyptic, and the second act may feature a motorbike duel with a robot B52, but it's the little things that really sell me on Gears of War 4 - the surprisingly delicate way it both harkens back to and departs from Epic's original cover-shooters. The fact that Swarm footsoldiers rush you when they're close to death, for example, where their Locust predecessors would often dig in till the bitter end. The presence of branching path sections that ask teams of two to support one another across a gulf, a classic Gears device enlivened by the addition of flying enemies and eccentric new flavours of sniper rifle.\n\nAnd then there's the Overkill shotgun, which perhaps encapsulates how well the Coalition understands the series it has inherited. On the surface it's a quad-barrelled monster worthy of Painkiller, but in practice the Overkill is a flexible instrument that, much like the famous Active Reload mechanic, challenges you to keep a cool head under pressure.\n\nSimply pull the trigger and you'll fire all four barrels at once to shattering effect. But if you hold the trigger, pause and release, you'll fire each pair of barrels separately for a tighter spread, allowing you to dent targets at range and really make the most of your ammo. Shotguns have always been Gears of War's principal skill weapons, the roaring Sphinxes that gate access to the upper echelons of competitive multiplayer. With the Overkill, the Coalition has crafted both an elegant tool for returning Gnasher pros and a bloodthirsty treat for the rest of us.\n\nEverywhere you look in Gears of War 4, you'll find a studio engaged in careful dialogue with the past. This is literally the case in the story, which takes place a few decades after the destruction of the Locust, and sees two generations of the Fenix clan fighting side by side. In a bid to shore up what remains of civilisation, the Coalition of Organised Governments has herded Sera's surviving humans into gigantic walled cities, defended by robots, but not everybody is content to trade their freedom for security. Amongst the rag-tag Outsiders who scrape a living in the wilderness is the one and only Marcus Fenix, he of the thousand yard scowl. As the game's second act begins, the COG is holding the Outsiders responsible for a spate of abductions, and new leading man JD Fenix has returned to his father's estate in hopes of guidance and a little covering fire, if not a hug.\n\nWhat follows is essentially a license handover reimagined as a family squabble, a clash between epochs in video game characterisation. JD is a blond and blue-eyed graduate of Nathan Drake High, accompanied by glib sidekick Delmont Walker and token ladybro Kait Diaz, whose parents are among the missing. Marcus remains a potty-mouthed crank, cut from the rock of the WW2 shooter and pickled to perfection by years of isolation. The script isn't exactly captivating so far - in opting for a more presentable college age cast, the Coalition has sacrificed a certain vivacity - but the reinvention of Marcus as a grouchy hermit, bellowing about his greenhouse in the midst of a COG bombing run, is worth a few laughs. I'm looking forward to finding out who else is back from Gears 3. With any luck, the Cole Train still operates somewhere deep in the wilds.\n\nThe art direction is also something of a generational mash-up. The Coalition has come up with its own spin on the original's \"destroyed beauty\" aesthetic - \"reclaimed beauty\", an admittedly clunky buzzword which pays into an unexpected riff on fossil fuel politics. By the time of Gears 4, Sera's reserves of underground immulsion are long gone, Mother Nature has taken back much of the surface, and the population now depends on a hodgepodge of renewable energy resources.\n\nThe game's plunging rural fastness is littered with the vestiges of the old world and ramshackle stabs at revival - windmills idling against a baleful sunset, enormous flywheels canted against cliff-faces, hydroelectric dams torn open by the \"windflares\" that now rake the planet's crust. In the course of the campaign's five acts (an estimated 10 hours) you'll take a ride in a deteriorating funicular and do battle inside a memorial to the Pendulum Wars, Sera's darkest hour prior to the emergence of the Locust. A hint: some of the antique weapons on display are functional.\n\nInspired by the landscape of north Italy, the game's palette is quietly enchanting - wiry underbrush and purple leafpile, mildew-spotted signage and ground-down masonry, flowing together in a way that makes the cover layouts less obvious to the eye, if no less tangible under the thumb. Gears of War's world has always been uniquely textured, and the Coalition has done a fine job of weaving its own vision into the tapestry, aided no end by some fancy bells and whistles - screen-space reflections on puddles, physically based shaders for a more tactile look, and a persistent dynamic weather system which, at its most severe, actually affects how you play.\n\nWhen the winds are raging, movement becomes a chore, certain terrain fixtures can be shot loose to create tumbling hazards, and slower projectiles such as the Boomshot's rounds may be blown off course, allowing you to sneak the odd shot around cover. If all this sounds transformative, however, the wind was seldom this much of a presence during my few hours with the campaign. For the most part, Gears of War 4's cover combat follows on from that of Gears 3, its AI behaviours, animations and even exploits painstakingly rebuilt to take advantage of Unreal Engine 4.\n\nThe basic rhythms are much as in any Gears game: you'll enter an area, slam your back against a pillar and work your way gradually around to flanking positions, overlooks and weapon drops, relying on AI comrades to revive you as and when you overreach yourself. The Coalition has added a few new tricks - you can reach across cover to haul a foe onto your combat knife, which adds an extra element of risk and reward to close-quarters gunplay - but any longtime Gears detractors hoping for a change of tune will come away disappointed.\n\nThere are, of course, new weapons to spice up the familiar double act of rifles versus shotguns. The Embar rifle handles like a mix of Torque Bow and Longshot - you must hold the trigger to charge up a slug, but if you hold it a second too long the weapon will vent, a blunder that's sure to rouse the scorn of Twitch chatboxes. The Buzzkill and Dropshot, meanwhile, are ways of cheating the game's cover logic. The former coughs up sawblades that ricochet around objects, while the latter spits out a flying drillhead that slams to earth explosively when you release the trigger.\n\nMore important than the new firearms, though, are the creatures you'll wield them against. Gears of War 4 introduces two new factions, the crusty Swarm and the COG's army of automatons or \"Dee Bees\". They share a number of familiar combat archetypes - units that pin you down, skirmishers that flush you out, and the odd towering bullet sponge equipped with a power weapon. But each faction boasts a few oddballs that may throw veteran players off-balance. The Dee Bees occasionally field Guardians, slippery UAVs that sport a chaingun or a rocket launcher (detachable, once you've shot the vehicle down) plus a recharging energy shield. Their rolling Tracker units are Kamikaze terrain denial weapons, exploding at your feet to create a brief but deadly puddle of static electricity.\n\nThe Swarm feel indistinguishable from the Locust at first, their rank and file emerging from sinkholes that can be sealed with a frag grenade, but just wait till you meet the Juvies - Swarm infants caught mid-gestation, fatty tissues dripping from their muscles as they hop and flail towards you. The original game's Wretches are the obvious comparison, but Juvies are much nimbler around objects and harder to hit - I was reminded a little of the Doom reboot's fidgety reinvention of the Imp, which is an encouraging parallel indeed. They also represent something of a terrain variable: you'll encounter Juvie egg sacks that can be used as cover, or shot down from the ceiling to squish anything beneath, but woe betide the player who rouses the occupant in the process.\n\nWeirder and deadlier still are the Swarm elites, especially the prancing Snatchers - they'll actually ingest you if they get the chance, carrying the hapless victim around in their bellies till blasted into submission. Carriers are the Swarm's artillery, their enormous torsos cracking open to release a cloud of toxic spores as they stomp slowly into melee range, and then there are the Pouncers, catlike, dart-tossing fiends with soft pink bellies that hop from surface to surface. As the name implies, Pouncers may try to pin you, but if you're alert to the warning signs you can usually catch the descending beast on the blade of a Lancer.\n\nBeyond the campaign, Gears 4 offers up a brace of familiar modes - Warzone, TDM, King of the Hill, and Guardian - plus the already discussed Dodgeball, a co-op bots mode and Arms Race, a team-based version of the Gun Game mod for Counter-Strike. In the latter, all team members get a different weapon after every third kill, which good news in that a struggling player won't be left behind, and less good news in"}

Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department\u2019s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers\u2019 Record of Sale Special Account.

The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "To many parents, it may be confirmation of something they have long suspected. A new study suggests that children pose a greater distraction to drivers than using a mobile telephone at the wheel.\n\nThe research involved an analysis of 12 families over a period of three weeks, in which all their car journeys were monitored by four cameras installed in their vehicle.\n\nThe families taking part had an average of two children, between 1-8 years of age. In total, 92 trips were analysed by the researchers, looking for any evidence of potentially distracting activity undertaken by the driver, such as looking away from the road for more than two seconds.\n\nIn 90 of the 92 trips studied, the team detected distracting activity on the part of the motorist, with the average parent taking their eyes off the road for three minutes and 22 seconds, during a 16 minute trip.\n\nThe video recordings showed that children travelling in the rear seats accounted for 12 per cent of all potentially distracting activity, compared to mobile phones, which were responsible for one per cent.\n\nFathers were more likely to engage in distracting activities with their children and were distracted for longer periods than their mothers.\n\nThe most frequent types of distractions included turning to look at the child in the rear seat or watching them in a rear-view mirror (76.4 per cent), engaging in conversation with the child (16 per cent), assisting the child in some way, such as handing them food or drinks, (seven per cent) or playing with the child (1 per cent).\n\nThe study found that the presence of a front seat passenger did not significantly affect the way in which drivers engaged in potentially distracting child-related activities.\n\nThe research was conducted by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, in Melbourne, Australia, where rules regarding the use of mobile phones while driving are similar to those in the UK, with hands free phones permitted.\n\nThe team say the results suggest that children are 12 times more distracting to motorists than talking on a mobile phone.\n\nDr Judith Charlton, an associate director of the centre, said: \u201cThe costs of distracted driving are undeniable. One major and previously unrecognised distraction is kids in the back seat.\u201d\n\nThe research comes just days after Brake, the road safety campaigners, supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers, called for tougher rules on mobile phones in cars, with a ban on hands-free devices, as well as hand-held ones. The charity also called for the penalty for calling or texting behind the wheel to be increased from \u00a3100 to somewhere between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000.\n\nBut Dr Charlton suggested that while the risks of distraction during driving are becoming increasingly well known, motorists often overlooked children as a source of the problem. She added that her research indicated there was a need for more education on the issue. Her team have now launched a larger study, involving 50 families.\n\nThe research comes just months after Norland College, the British nanny school, was involved in the launch of Nanny Drive iQ, a specialist driving school to teach childcare professionals techniques about driving with children.\n\nSarah Rowley, from the driving school, said: \u201cParents expect those who care for their children to have relevant qualifications, but often let a carer or nanny drive off with their children without knowing how skilled and confident they are behind the wheel.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Oh, space. You're so hard to explore. Sometimes you bombard spacecrafts with hurtling rocks and deadly cosmic rays, and other times you're so empty you don't give astronauts a darn thing to hold on to. But while scientists haven't quite figured out how to keep radiation at bay, the scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u2014specifically, its Planetary Robotics Laboratory\u2014are building machines that can get a grip on the most difficult surfaces astronauts will find out there.\n\nAdhesion-wise, space presents a couple problems. First, robots typically struggle with uneven surfaces, let alone the kind of cliffs and crags you see on Mars. Second, space is kind of gravity challenged. \"Out in zero gravity, even pushing tape against surfaces is difficult,\" say Jaakko Karras, a robotics electrical engineer at JPL. Without gravity to anchor your feet to the ground, it's easy to run afoul of Newton's third law. (For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So you'll be pushed away from the wall with the same amount of force you applied to it. Physics!)\n\nAnd that's not just a problem in microgravity. Low gravity environments, like asteroids or comets, can be uncooperative too. (Just ask the European Space Agency's Philae lander.) \"If you got out there and wanted to do some sort of sampling and just started drilling, you\u2019re more likely to spin about the drill bit than the drill bit into the surface,\" Karras says.\n\nSo what's a robot to do? \"Nature solves the problems around us all the time,\" says Karras. \"A fairly common path for us is the biomimicry approach.\" When Karras and his team would test climbing robots out on vertical rock walls, lizards would blaze right past them. But rather than getting annoyed at the speedy little reptiles, Karras decided to take his cues from evolution instead. His team's adhesive makes use of van der Waals forces, which geckos use to climb smooth surfaces. For bumpy ones, his team built claw-inspired microspine grippers that can bend and flex. (You can see them in action in the video up top.)\n\nBoth gecko adhesive and microspine grippers are well on their way to scoring a ticket to deep space. Gecko adhesive is already being tested on the International Space Station. Right now, astronauts are using it to anchor things to interior panels, but NASA is considering using it as a replacement for Velcro, which kicks off a lot of dust and bristles\u2014particulates aren't all that welcome in the fragile environment of the ISS. And microspines are a crucial part of NASA's asteroid redirect mission: The little spikes will cover robotic arms used to snatch up an asteroid's boulder and deposit it in orbit around our moon.\n\nKarras also hopes that future missions will use microspines' vertical climbing skills to explore Mars' caves and lava tubes. \"They haven't been explored yet because they're difficult from a mobility standpoint,\" Karras says. \"But they may once have been collection points for liquid water, and they're sheltered, low-radiation areas. They're of interest for investigating the possibility of past and present life.\" So if we find any Martians in the next couple of decades, you have lizards to thank."}

It cited 14 deaths in custody - four unexplained, six alleged suicides and four from illness - and documented 31 cases of police beatings, among whose victims were eight children.\n\nRobertson said the report was far from a quantitative survey and \u201cmore a snapshot of a serious situation\u201d. The rights group did not interview witnesses or suspects itself for fear it could put them in danger.\n\nIt drew largely on what it described as patchy coverage of the issue in by Vietnam\u2019s state-controlled media and from bloggers keen to document cases of police brutality.\n\nReforming the police force could, however, be a tall order in Vietnam. The force is overseen by the Ministry of Public Security, which has a big stake in politics and numerous areas of society and administration.\n\nSeveral ministers, current and former, are politburo members and the remit of the ministry is far-reaching.\n\n\u201cSTRONG COMMITMENT\u201d\n\nThe rights group recommended that the government establish an independent police complaints commission, local-level internal affairs units, a tracking system to address allegations of abuse and ensure interrogations of suspects were videotaped.\n\nVietnam\u2019s government rejected what it said were \u201cfalse allegations\u201d in the report, citing its signing of the U.N. treaty against torture and inhumane acts as evidence of strong commitment to preventing abuses of suspects in police custody.\n\n\u201cEvery act of torture and corporal punishment during investigation and trial processes will be strictly handled in accordance with Vietnamese law,\u201d deputy Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Tran Thi Bich, said in a statement.\n\nMinister of Public Security Tran Dai Quang last week said during a hearing of the justice committee of Vietnam\u2019s parliament that action was being taken against policemen accused of abuses and cases had risen from 2011 to the end of last year.\n\nQuang said that of the 828 police accused of \u201cinfringing upon judicial activities\u201d, 23 were charged with using corporal punishment. Quang did not disclose if any had been jailed. Robertson described the hearing as remarkable but said far more needed to be done.\n\n\u201cFor now, it\u2019s clear that the Vietnam police are mostly getting away with these abuses,\u201d he said."}

Gucci is a New York-based celebrity make-up artist who works with all the stars, including Demi Moore and Jennifer Garner. And Jackie is the make-up artist on The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent.\n\nHere, they select the products we really need and give their differing views on how to use them...\n\nDebating the truth: Make-up artists Laura Mercier (left), Gucci Westman (centre), and Jackie Tyson (right)\n\nShould you apply primer on top of freshly cleansed skin or on top of moisturiser?\n\nLAURA: Primer is a protective layer that seals in moisturiser and provides a smooth surface for foundation.\n\nIf you have an oily complexion, you may feel that the primer without moisturiser is enough.\n\nGUCCI: My routine is more about colour- correcting, treating and highlighting the skin. A product that gives you an immaculate canvas is a pore minimiser, which would be my equivalent to a primer.\n\nI use it only around the T-zone, where pores need to be made to look smooth and match the rest of the skin. Apply after moisturiser, and before you apply your foundation.\n\nJACKIE: A primer provides a base for your foundation, which will ensure it will stay put longer, but will also help give the illusion of flawless, radiant skin.\n\nTry Avon MagiX Face Perfector, \u00a37 (avonshop. co.uk) or Beauty Flash Balm by Clarins, \u00a326.50 (from Boots), which is a cult classic.\n\nThe X Factor: Jackie Tyson cannot live without her eyelash curlers and disposable mascara wands\n\nWhich make-up tools can\u2019t you live without?\n\nLAURA: My camouflage brush to apply concealer - it allows me to pinpoint areas where I need more coverage.\n\nGUCCI: My sponges - they are amazingly soft.\n\nJACKIE: My Shu Uemura Eyelash Curlers, \u00a319.50 (020 240 7635).

Then apply highlighter to cheekbones, bridge of the nose and cupid's bow, pat it in with your fingers, and smooth out with a brush. Revlon brushes from \u00a36.99 (Superdrug).\n\nJACKIE: Use foundation only where you need it: around the eyes, nose and mouth. Blend well with a brush or fingers.\n\nHow can you get a lovely, healthy glow using bronzer without looking unnatural?\n\nLAURA: Never overload your brush, and match texture to texture. A cream or gel is perfect over liquid foundation, for example.\n\nIf you don't want a powdery look, use a blusher with a hint of pearl to lift the texture and add a glow.\n\nGUCCI: For mature skin, the more cream textures you can use, the better. Avoid powders as much as possible. It's easy to get a natural look with blusher - it's all in the blending.\n\nAfter applying cream or powder blush, simply dust over the area with a clean powder brush.\n\nJACKIE: Avoid powder bronzers for a more mature skin. POP Beauty has a fabulously easy-to-apply cheek stain called Apples Of The Cheeks, \u00a312 (popbeauty.co.uk), that looks great on any skin tone and can be applied with fingertips.\n\nBreak out of your eyeshadow rut: Bellapierre has a good range of shimmer powders\n\nHow can you break out of a colour rut with eye shadow?\n\nLAURA: Seek the advice of an in-store make-up artist - they'll give an objective opinion. When applying eye shadow, use a little at a time; it's easier to add more than take some off.\n\nGUCCI: Go for a eye make-up palette that combines a few of your safer, familiar tones with a range of new colours.\n\nJACKIE: Try to complement your outfit with make-up rather than match it. Bella Pierre has a good range of shimmer powders - individual pots cost \u00a312.99 or a stack of nine is \u00a359.99 (bellapierre.co.uk).\n\nCan you define your mouth and get long-lasting colour that doesn't look too fake?\n\nLAURA: Apply lipstick by dabbing with your finger to create the shape. The colour will look far more natural, and the pressing action will grind its pigment onto your lips.\n\nGUCCI: Apply lip colour using your fingers, pat it on and clean up the edges with a small concealer brush. Revlon's new Colorburst lipstick, \u00a37.99 (Superdrug and Boots) has a great lip balm feeling and provides a huge amount of colour.\n\nJACKIE: Colour is best applied sparingly over the top of a good lip primer to fill in fine lines around the lip line. Blend gently with the ring finger. When buying lipstick, get exactly the same colour lip liner.\n\nAfter applying a primer, such as Elizabeth Arden Advanced Lip-Fix Cream, \u00a318 (Boots and department stores; 020 7574 2714 for stockists), apply the liner all over the lips to provide a colour base and give the lipstick something to cling to.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Okay, are y\u2019all ready for the longest sex question I\u2019ve ever answered? Because this one\u2019s a doozy. Normally we edit the questions down to a nice size, but there\u2019s a lot going on here and I think all of it\u2019s valuable. So we\u2019re publishing most of this question, almost intact:\n\nI have been in a relationship with a bisexual girl for more than 10 months. We have a pretty okay relationship, we have our strong differences but there are things about her that I do adore. However, we are having some bedroom issues.\n\nIn February 2013, she went for an operation to remove a couple of cysts in her womb and she has been put on the mini-pill ever since. And since after that, our sex life has gone from hero to zero. We have had many chats (both peaceful and heated) about the lack thereof and she has said on many occasions that she will decide when we have sex. She said it\u2019s her body and she has a right to decide what someone else can do with it.\n\nI definitely have a higher libido than she does and here, I\u2019m not sure if it is because she has had sex with men or women (I\u2019m not her first girl) who have been demanding and have forced themselves on her. But all this is making me afraid to initiate sex in fear of rejection and yet I feel that it\u2019s unfair that sex should solely be on her terms. She sees penetration as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of her body and it is getting increasingly frustrating for me.\n\nI do not want to jeopardize the relationship\u2014I know sex isn\u2019t everything but I don\u2019t feel the intimacy with her. She says that I always want instant gratification that I get from sex and I always want it when I want it, which is not true. It seems that she only wants sex when she\u2019s drunk or when she feels like it. Please help. I don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nAlrighty, dear reader. This is going to be a multipart opus, because you\u2019ve actually asked a lot of questions here, not just one.\n\nI want to start, though, by commending you for not calling this lesbian bed death. I feel like that term gets bandied about a lot and it implies that a difference in libido is somehow a lesbian-specific phenomenon. It\u2019s not. Any couple, no matter how they identify, can face this issue.\n\nSo now let\u2019s start by picking apart these questions, one by one, and see if we can\u2019t unwind this tangled ball of string into a more manageable spool.\n\nMedications Make A Difference\n\nYou\u2019ve acknowledged that there might be an external cause for the gap between your libidos. Medication, hormones, stress\u2014these are all things that can make a difference in one\u2019s desire to have sex. So it could be that this is a storm that you can weather\u2014is she on this medication temporarily? Or it could be that she\u2019s on the wrong medication for her. I don\u2019t know enough about her medical condition (or about medical conditions in general) to tell you if that\u2019s the case, but it\u2019s something about which she can certainly talk to her doctor. However, some medications are long-term and have unavoidable libido side-effects\u2014which might mean that this is the new normal. So what could that mean for you?\n\nHer Body Is, In Fact, Hers\n\nShe says that her body is hers and she can decide who does what with it when, and that\u2019s 100% correct. Even in your horniest state, it would be super ultra mega no-good to pressure her into having sex. Remember that consent counts only when it\u2019s enthusiastic. You have the right to pursue a sexually fulfilling relationship, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your girlfriend is personally obligated to sexually fulfill you even when she doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nBut there is another side to that equation\u2014your body is yours, and you are allowed to want things done to it. And you\u2019re allowed to seek out those things. It\u2019s normal and wonderful to want sex and to seek it out. So let\u2019s talk about the ways you can do that within the parameters you\u2019ve described.\n\nThe Price Of Admission\n\nBefore everyone gets on my case for using an idea that Dan Savage popularized, let me be clear. Dan Savage has said some VERY problematic things in his career, as many have. But he has helped normalize talking about sex and has contributed to the culture of being open and honest about our wants and needs. And this particular idea of his, despite so many problems with his other ideas, is a real winner.\n\nBasically, think of your partner as a ride (while still thinking of them as a person! I\u2019m not suggesting you objectify your partner!). There is a price you pay to ride the ride, and that price is often a compromise. I\u2019ll give you an example from my own life: my girlfriend is wicked smart. Like, the kind of smart you cannot even believe exists. But she does have this weakness. And that weakness is Say Yes To The Dress. Sure, most of the time we\u2019re watching thought-provoking documentaries or really excellent foreign films or any number of other things that are WAY MORE INTELLIGENT than Say Yes To The Dress. But the price of admission for my girlfriend is that sometimes we are gonna marathon this show and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. If there is a Say Yes To The F*cking Dress marathon, that is what we are watching. Instead of fighting against it, I go with it and we have fun critiquing the wedding industrial complex together. I\u2019ve even come to grudgingly love it and find my inner Monte.\n\n(My girlfriend\u2019s note here: YOU DID NOT SPECIFY SAY YES TO THE DRESS ATLANTA! SAY ATLANTA! I HAVE MY STANDARDS.)\n\nYou can apply this idea to sex as well. I\u2019ll give you another example from my own life: I cannot keep my mouth shut during sex. I dunno, I just let forth a torrent of filthy talk every time I get naked. That\u2019s the price of admission for me\u2014I don\u2019t necessarily need someone to reciprocate it, I just need someone who\u2019s okay with me doing that. Because I like it and I really don\u2019t want to not do it.\n\nSometimes price of admission can change \u2014 it sounds like her boundaries about sex and penetration might be more recent, and may not have been there when you began this relationship, but that doesn\u2019t make them less valid.\n\nIn your case, it sounds like you both have different prices of admission when it comes to having sex at all. Your price of admission is frequent sex. Her price of admission is no penetration, or only when she\u2019s completely into it. Thus the apparent libido gap. Which brings me to my next point:\n\nSex Can Be More Than Penetration\u2026\n\nIn your question, you state \u201cshe sees penetration as an \u2018invasion\u2019 of her body.\u201d But if penetration is your criterion for sex, I\u2019d challenge you to broaden your definition. Sex is a huge category that covers a bunch of different acts. Here are a few suggestions for things that could be considered sex that are not you penetrating her.\n\nUsing a vibrator on her.\n\nHer using a vibrator on you.\n\nMutual masturbation!\n\nNon-mutual masturbation/watching each other masturbate!\n\nHer penetrating you (fingers, dildo, back door or front door if ya catch my drift).\n\nOral sex!\n\nBDSM acts without penetration. (Yes, you can just flog someone and leave it there! Totally a thing!)\n\nAnd much much more!\n\nWhenever someone, a couple of someones, or multiple someones talk to me about a perceived libido gap, I always have to check and make sure they\u2019re on the same page when it comes to defining sex for themselves as an individual, couple or group. Everyone has certain things they\u2019re into, and when you\u2019re having sex with someone else, you\u2019re going to do the things that you\u2019re both into, the acts where your interests intersect. Think of it as a Venn diagram.\n\nIt could be you\u2019re both thinking you\u2019ve got a huge libido gap because you\u2019re both defining sex as acts totally on the opposite sides of your circles, but actually there are certain things you\u2019re both into doing together that fall smack in the middle and are totally still sex acts. The only way to find out about that is to talk about it. For a more complete list of sex acts to peruse, I recommend this list on Scarleteen (yes, yes, I know, I am always talking about it, but that\u2019s because the yes/no/maybe list is so good!) or this (admittedly a bit cheesy) interactive sex questionnaire. Your libido gap may not be as large as you think, you might just be looking in the wrong place on the diagram.\n\nOr you discover that no, in fact, your libido gap (the difference between your respective prices of sexytime admission) is exactly as large as you think it is and it is truly a difference in how often you want"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "LANSING, MI -- Enbridge directors say there are no areas where bare Line 5 metal is exposed to Great Lakes water but admitted during a Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board meeting the outer coating layer has failed in places and the company doesn't usually repair that kind of protection system. Kurt Baraniecki, Enbridge director of pipeline integrity, told the state board on Monday, March 13 that anticorrosion protections on the controversial pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac are \"working as designed,\" but there are 18 places where there is coating \"\n\n.\"\n\nBaraniecki said a federal work plan incorrectly identified the delamination spots along the pipeline as \"holidays,\" where the multi-layered coating has been completely lost and bare pipe metal is exposed. Baraniecki said \"the consultants had generalized this\" language in a\n\nto assess the impact of invasive quagga and zebra mussels on the twin underwater pipeline segment, a required part of a civil\n\nEnbridge reached with the U.S. Justice Department last year following the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill. \"These are locations we've identified that could potentially have coating holidays,\" he said. Divers \"are going to each of those locations to take samples of the biota and visually inspect the coating to see if it is still intact.\" He said Enbridge is \"confident it is still intact\" because of constant monitoring. Baraniecki's presentation was the main event at a rowdy pipeline board meeting on Monday that featured several busloads of protestors who packed the hearing room at the Michigan Public Service Commission building on W. Saginaw Highway. Security estimated there were about 260 attending, not including media, board members and state staff. Board co-chair Valerie Brader admonished the hostile audience several times during Baraniecki's presentation, reminding them that shouted questions, jeers and other interruptions only ate time away from the public comment period. At one point, a Petoskey man and his grandson sitting in the front row briefly left the meeting for the bathroom, where they undressed and coated themselves in chocolate cake batter to make a visual statement about the threat of a spill.\n\nMan and grandson cover themselves in cake batter at rowdy Line 5 meeting \"We wanted show you what the birds will look like... if the line breaks.\"\n\nThe packed meeting followed confusion related to Enbridge's biota investigation plan, which pipeline board member Jennifer McKay of the Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council stumbled across on the company website in February. The plan\n\nwith the pipeline board because it referred to numerous holidays in the pipeline coating that had been identified during a June 2016 inspection of the pipeline. Enbridge called the holidays \"\n\n,\" but agreed to give a detailed presentation. In a March 8 letter, Attorney General Bill Schuette, Department of Natural Resources director Keith Creagh and Department of Environmental Quality director Heidi Grether called Enbridge's characterization of the holidays as merely hypothetical \"confusing in light of the terms of the plan itself,\" which clearly identified them in maps and diagrams. Using a series of slides, Baraniecki said the pipeline has a coal tar enamel coating layer under two layers of outer fiberglass wrap, and cathodic protection inspections show the enamel layer is \"still intact,\" although photographs show the outer wrap layer is missing, or \"delaminated,\" in spots. He said a consultant that created the biota work plan, Gulf Interstate Engineering (GIE), used data from Ballard Marine and identified places where they believed bare pipe was exposed to the water, but Enbridge concluded it was a \"mistake.\"\n\nEnbridge director of pipeline integrity Kurt Baraniecki explains why Line 5 has delaminated outer coating during the Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board meeting on March 13.\n\nHe said in-line inspection tools have not detected any holidays, but the delamination areas were discovered by visual inspection last year. \"We're not certain what is causing the delamination\" but they hope to figure that out. This year, Enbridge plans to hydrostatic test the original pipeline pressure used in 1953 when the line was installed to demonstrate the lines are as \"good as they were when they were brand new.\" The maximum pressure allowed on the line is 600 pounds-per-square-inch and Baraniecki said the company will test the line at double that level. As part of the biota survey, divers will look at delamination areas and \"if there are holidays, we will assess whether we need to do any repairs.\" Baraniecki said the purpose of the outer layers is to protect the pipe during construction and to prevent abrasion from soil or sediment during the line's lifespan, so it being compromised shouldn't diminish the coating system. \"The outer wrap is not something we'd typically repair.\" That statement got the attention of Michigan State Police Captain Chris Kelenske, the state's emergency management coordinator. \"If the outer wrap was necessary when it was put in, why would we not repair it, regardless of whatever the testing is?\" he asked. Brad Shamla, Enbridge vice president of U.S. operations, jumped in. \"We don't believe that going in and doing a repair is going to change the corrosion protections at all, but it's certainly something to look at,\" Shamla said, adding that the delamination spots amounted to \"less than 0.1 percent of the system.\" Kelenske replied that, \"from where I sit, any percent above zero is not good.\"\n\nEnbridge Line 5 may be 'one peak current event' from failure, says scientist Meanwhile, state officials seek info about 'hypothetical' defects in pipeline coating.\n\nAfter the meeting, McKay said the presentation left her with more questions. \"I think Enbridge needs to do a full analysis on the coating and look at the outer wrap, inner wrap, coal tar enamel and determine what is the extent of loss and what does it ultimately mean for the fitness of service for this pipeline,\" she said. Board member Mike Shriberg, regional director for the National Wildlife Federation, said he had a hard time squaring Baraniecki's assertion that the line was as good as new when there's delamination in the outer wrap. \"A pipeline that's in 'like new' condition isn't missing part of its coating,' he said. Shriberg, who represents an organization that is active in opposition to the pipeline in the public realm and in the court system, said Enbridge appears not to really know the depth of coating loss at certain points on its pipeline. \"They're assuming it's just the outer wrap -- which is bad in and of itself -- but it could be much deeper,\" he said. \"It left me with more questions than I started with.\" After the meeting, Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company is satisfied that Baraniecki showed there's no exposed metal on the pipeline. As for the outer wrap delamination, Duffy said it \"doesn't play a role in preventing corrosion, necessarily. It's just the outer thin wrap on the line. Bottom line: There's no exposed metal anywhere along the line. There's no holidays.\""}

There are some good hand puns: America, the ad declares, needs \"a president who can grasp the complexity of the world and hold off the decline of a great nation.\"\n\n\"If the White House phone rings at 3 am, will his little hands even pick up the receiver?\" one woman asks worriedly.\n\nThe video is tapping into a rich vein of criticism that Trump has historically found very difficult to tolerate: Call him a racist or a bully or a xenophobe if you must, but do not, under any circumstances, insult the length of his fingers.\n\nDuring the primaries, Sen. Marco Rubio was the first to pick up on it: \"I don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5-foot-2,\" Rubio said during his brief insult comic phase: \"And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can't trust them.\" (That isn't actually what they say about men with small hands, but we'll get to that in a minute.)\n\nJokes about Trump's small hands \u2014 or, in the phrasing more commonly used before 2016, his short fingers \u2014 have a long, entertaining, very Trump-like backstory. His sensitivity to the insult dates back decades.\n\nWhy Trump really hates the insult \"short-fingered vulgarian\"\n\nAccusations of below-average finger size have dogged Trump for nearly 30 years. In 1988, Spy, a satirical magazine based in New York, coined an epithet for Trump that it would gleefully repeat for eight years: \"short-fingered vulgarian.\"\n\nSpy, which was published from 1986 to 1998, was busy skewering celebrities and public figures as Trump was building his national profile. Proudly avaricious and braggadocious, Trump embodied the spirit of the '80s. And Spy made him a frequent target of not just insults but also elaborate practical jokes.\n\n\"Donald Trump was our clickbait,\" Bruce Feirstein, a contributing editor for Spy, wrote for Vanity Fair in 2015:\n\nHe brought us word-of-mouth recognition, and more readers\u2014just the same way he is now bringing eyeballs to newscasts, and page views to Web sites\u2026 Over the course of our years at Spy, we fact-checked his books and his finances (with predictable results), trolled him by sending miniscule checks \u2014 as low as 13 cents \u2014to see if he\u2019d cash them (he did), and wrote up his all-but-forgotten business debacles. (Remember the \"Trump Castle World Power Boat Championship\"?)\n\n\"Two-month anniversary of the publication of short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal,\" Spy noted in January 1988, its first use of the phrase. \"Reader \u2026 is rushed to the hospital with hubris shock.\" (The same issue, presciently, floated the possibility of a Trump presidential bid, citing a survey that found 4 percent of Americans were sad he wasn't in the running.)\n\nSpy would call Trump a \"short-fingered vulgarian\" 12 times in the next eight years, including once reprinting a correction from the Stanford student newspaper, which had written the phrase as \"short-fingered Bulgarian\" and had to apologize for insulting Bulgarians.\n\nTrump, an expert troll, was getting trolled. He rose to the bait, responding in characteristic fashion: scribbling on the article in Sharpie marker and sending it to its writers. (\"Face of a dog!\" he once wrote over a photo of New York Times columnist Gail Collins, who had committed the other ultimate infraction: downplaying Trump's wealth by calling him a \"thousandaire.\")\n\nWhat upset Trump wasn't being called a \"vulgarian,\" a rich person with bad manners. It was the slur on his finger length.\n\n\"To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump,\" Graydon Carter, a founder of Spy and now the editor of Vanity Fair, wrote in 2015.\n\n\"There is always a photo of him \u2014 generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby.\"\n\nRubio's \"small hands\" joke was probably a slur on Trump's penis size\n\nBefore we get any further into the saga of Trump's hands, here's one important note: It is not at all clear that Trump's fingers are, in fact, unusually short. But what matters is that Trump himself seems to believe short-fingeredness is a terrible accusation that must be refuted.\n\nThe Washington Post's Philip Bump conducted a thorough investigation that included, among other things, the photographic concept of foreshortening, a 1902 study of the finger lengths of imprisoned criminals, and a comparison of the size of Trump's hands with the size of a sheet of paper.\n\nBump's conclusion: \"Trump is not a 'short-fingered vulgarian,' for the sole reason that he is not short-fingered.\"\n\nStill, Trump seems to take a slur on his fingers as a terrible insult, for reasons that Spy was far too arch to make explicit.\n\nPalm readers, for one, have a host of stereotypes about short-fingered people: They're impulsive, stubborn, unconcerned with detail, prone to jumping to conclusions, and interested above all in doing big things. (\"They build enormous buildings,\" the Benham Book of Palmistry even notes.) But while that's a scarily accurate description of Trump, it's unlikely this is what Spy meant.\n\nFinger size also could be linked to testosterone, and has been cited as a predictor of everything from athletic prowess to ruthlessness on a trading floor. But that research \u2014 which, in any case, was conducted long after Spy first called Trump short-fingered \u2014 deals with the ratio of the length of a man's ring finger to the length of his index finger, not how long or short the fingers in question are.\n\nTrump was probably drawing a much less obscure conclusion: He thought Spy was implying he had a small penis. \"My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my body,\" he told the New York Post's Page Six in 2006. \"From what I hear, the same cannot be said of editors of the failed Spy.\"\n\nTrump, as Trump does, was making the subtext text. While there are some superstitions linking hand size to strength of character, a far more common association is that small hands are an indication of, um, smallness elsewhere. (Urban Dictionary was on the case in 2008: \"If you say someone has small hands it means that they have a small penis.\")\n\nAnd Rubio's remark has put the old jokes about Trump's hand size back into circulation, from funny tweets in March to the PAC today.\n\nHastily-Arranged News Conference Just Excuse for Trump to Show Off New Hands pic.twitter.com/CNJxNpLQV0 \u2014 Daniel Lin (@DLin71) March 2, 2016\n\nIt might set Trump's mind to rest if it were more widely known that the connection between hand size and penis size is spurious at best. The connection has been studied twice, once finding only a weak correlation and once finding no relationship at all.\n\nBut the feud over whether Trump is a \"short-fingered vulgarian\" has now lasted nearly 30 years. It would be a shame to stop it now."}

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \"Brotherly Leader\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism. The son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder, Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Founding a revolutionary cell within the military, in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic. Ruling by decree, he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments. Intent on pushing Libya towards \"Islamic socialism\", he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973 he initiated a \"Popular Revolution\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in The Green Book. In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state, the Jamahiriya (\"state of the masses\"). Officially adopting a symbolic role in governance, he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents. Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing led to Libya's label of \"international pariah\". A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions. Rejecting his earlier ideological commitments, from 1999 Gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with Western nations, also embracing Pan-Africanism and serving as Chairperson of the African Union from 2009\u201310. Amid the Arab Spring, in 2011 an anti-Gaddafist uprising led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) broke out, resulting in the Libyan Civil War. NATO intervened militarily on the side of the NTC, bringing about the government's downfall. Retreating to Sirte, Gaddafi was captured and killed by NTC militants. Gaddafi was a controversial and highly divisive world figure. Supporters lauded his anti-imperialist stance and his support for Pan-Africanism and Pan-Arabism, and he was decorated with various awards. Conversely, he was internationally condemned as a dictator and autocrat whose authoritarian administration violated the human rights of Libyan citizens, and supported irredentist movements, tribal warfare and terrorism in many other nations.\n\nTotal views:\n\n408"}

I already am labeled as such!) just for writing about this story.\n\nBut, it isn\u2019t me saying this, it is an immigration lawyer whose livelihood depends on more immigration just as a used car salesman looking for refugees to sell to (not disparaging used car salesmen!) does, or a nursing home owner who is trying to get workers at the cheapest hourly wage he can get!\n\nHere is the story from Maine. \u2018Lawyer, employer encourage hiring more refugees\u2018 which reports that refugees are now being spread out further from the normal resettlement sites in Maine (thanks to Catholic Charities).\n\n\u201cWhy are we so old?\u201d immigration attorney Jennifer Atkinson asked a small crowd gathered Nov. 16 for a talk about her work, hosted by the Camden Conference at Rockport Opera House.\n\n\u201cLook around\u2026\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re white. We\u2019re so old because we\u2019re so white.\u201d\n\nShe put the area\u2019s demographics bluntly, calling the Midcoast \u201ca bastion of whiteness\u201d within the oldest and whitest state in the country.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nWhile some residents might be content with this, Atkinson said it doesn\u2019t bode well for Maine\u2019s economy or its future.\n\nWhen you read these next lines consider this: I\u2019m white and old enough to remember when the pressure on all of us college grads was to have ONLY two children or risk killing the planet. Guess who didn\u2019t listen to that\u2014the rest of the brown world didn\u2019t listen! Heck we have 9/11 mastermind KSM telling interrogators that they are going to take us over by outbreeding us!\n\nStatistically speaking, there is a correlation between whiteness, oldness and slow population growth.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nMaine\u2019s aging and decreasing population (the state had a net loss of 928 people last year) leads to cascading problems: low school enrollment, pressures on budgets, strains on services \u2014 especially health care \u2014 and declines in the working-age labor force.

It is about a nursing home owner who has figured out that he can hire refugee labor probably much cheaper than a Mainer. When making arguments about why they hire refugees they NEVER admit it is about the hourly wage. They could probably find Americans for this work if they paid a decent wage! But, that would mess up their bottomlines!\n\n(Your tax dollars subsidize the family\u2019s needs when wages are too low.)\n\nLOL! Big business owners are always pretending they are doing God\u2019s work by hiring refugees!\n\nHaving had some experience with nursing homes in recent years, any one of you considering finding one for your elderly family member, especially one with some form of dementia, make sure that all those caring for your loved one (no matter their skin color) SPEAK ENGLISH WELL. It is hard enough for the mentally impaired as it is, and they need to be able to communicate well with a nursing aid. Something as benign seeming as a urinary tract infection can kill if not detected in time.\n\nQuestions I want answered:\n\nWhy is that Leftwingers are always pushing for more population growth (to fuel the economy) when they must know that growth of that sort will necessarily bring some degradation of the environment\u2014more cars, more roads, more houses, more school construction, less open space, etc? I don\u2019t get it! If there is some Open Borders Leftwinger who would like to explain it to me and our readers, I would very much welcome a guest column.\n\nAnd this too?

(Photo11: Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights Izzo thinks people stopped talking about/thinking about the Spartans after the UConn loss\n\nIzzo says going through the Big Ten's top teams might be tougher than the NCAA tournament\n\nIzzo says Draymond Green is one of those great players that rarely comes along\n\nEach Friday leading up to the NCAA tournament, USA TODAY Sports' Nicole Auerbach catches up with a premier college basketball coach:\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. \u2013 This week, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo is happy \u2013 or as happy as he can be when he says he still can't tell how good his team is. (Here's my hint: Pretty good.) Izzo's Spartans are coming off their most spectacular and dominating win of the season, a 75-52 rout of rival Michigan, the best win Izzo said he's seen from his team in three years.\n\nOnce again, Michigan State is being touted as a Big Ten title contender (and is sitting atop the conference standings with Indiana at the moment) and a national championship contender, too. If there's one thing we've learned about college basketball this season, it's we should never count out a coach like Izzo and a balanced, talented team like the Spartans.\n\nSitting in his office Thursday morning, Izzo caught up with USA TODAY Sports about his team flying under the radar for much of the season, the brutal Big Ten schedule and what every great college basketball team needs \u2013 a fantastic leader.\n\nIzzo on why people haven't been talking much about the Spartans until recently:\n\nBUBBLE TRACKER: Who's in and who's out\n\nWe had some question marks coming in. You have to remember the (Branden) Dawson (torn ACL). He didn't start shooting the ball again until September, so that's seven months. Most people say you aren't any good until the year after. Adrian Peterson kind of screwed up that theory. That was a key thing. Our point guard \u2013 would he come into his own? He was a 2 guard playing the point. Would he grow? We had a couple of freshmen we knew we'd have to rely on, especially (Denzel) Valentine and (Gary) Harris. Those are unknowns.\n\nThat, along with you take Michigan \u2013 they had (Trey) Burke and (Tim) Hardaway coming back. They had some things to plug, too, but usually a team is going to have a chance to go far with its guards. It's like if you have a great quarterback, you're going to have a better chance to go somewhere.\n\nUsually, most years, we lose a couple of games early and we go from top five, top seven, top 12 to 20th and we're kind of off the radar. Most of the time, we play a schedule that's different than most people. This year, we lose to UConn and lose at Miami before Miami's anything.\n\nMAILBAG: Duke-UNC, Izzo and more\n\nIzzo on the challenge of Michigan State's upcoming Big Ten schedule:\n\n(In a 17-day stretch starting Feb. 19), ours is Indiana here, at Ohio State, at Michigan and Wisconsin here. That's concentrated. If you threw something in there, like Penn State, then you at least have some breathing room. You have to get up for every game. That's harder than the NCAA tournament. In the NCAA tournament, there's more space in between. We just came off three games in six days. When you're traveling and going to school, that's hard. When everybody tries to compare these conferences, there is no comparison. I've been in this 30 years. There's no comparison to what the top teams in our league are going through.\n\nIzzo on the importance of great leadership, like he had in recent years with Draymond Green:\n\nHe is rare. You know what happens with rare guys? You go to Final Fours. \u2026 That was another Jud (Heathcote) line when we won the national championship. He calls me four days later, and he always tells me I work too much. \u2026 He says, 'Take some time off. You better enjoy this.' I said, 'Yeah, I'll enjoy it.' He says, 'You really better enjoy it.' He says, 'You don't understand, this comes around every 20 years.' I say, 'Oh, I have to wait 20 more years to get to a Final Four, this or that?' Nope, he says, having that kind of leader. It was Magic (Johnson). It was Mateen (Cleaves). ... Thirteen years later, Draymond came around, and he's not far off.\n\nThat's what's missing at a lot of programs.\n\n(Izzo then mentioned Indiana's Victor Oladipo and Michigan's Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway Jr. as guys, like Draymond Green, who weren't really, really hyped or highly rated coming out of high school but have developed into their teams' leaders. He also discussed how programs like Duke, UNC and Kansas have talented upperclassmen who could have gone pro stay, and then they in turn teach underclassmen how to grow into leaders. Interesting stuff about what makes these teams successful.)"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Another day, another batch of mostly redundant and anonymously sourced stories about whether Vice President Joe Biden will run for president. Some of those stories, however, are getting ridiculous. So FiveThirtyEight\u2019s politics writers met in Slack to pick over the latest Biden coverage, our own assumptions and the state of the 2016 Democratic primary. This is an edited transcript of the conversation.\n\nmicah (Micah Cohen, senior editor): So, the will he/won\u2019t he speculation about Joe Biden hasn\u2019t slowed down, but do either of you buy the argument that a Biden run could actually help Hillary Clinton?\n\nhjenten-heynawl (Harry Enten, senior political writer): I don\u2019t think it would be particularly helpful to Clinton. Forget about all the BS about whether Clinton runs better when she\u2019s in trouble. Personally, I never got that. If she were so good at running when she was in trouble, then why did she lose in 2008?\n\nRather, why would Biden run? Sure, he\u2019s in his 70s and this is his last shot, but he also has a family to take care of. He\u2019d likely only run if he concludes he has a better than nominal chance of winning. And that conclusion would be quite different from what the current metrics, such as endorsements, suggest. Biden may have an insight on the invisible primary that isn\u2019t visible to the rest of us.\n\nnatesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): The irony is that the media has exaggerated all sorts of threats to Clinton, who remains in good shape for the nomination. But then you have the one thing that would be a tangibly bad sign for her campaign \u2014 the vice president of the United States running for the nomination against her! \u2014 and there are lots of \u201csmart takes\u201d about how it could help Clinton.\n\nhjenten-heynawl: What we\u2019ve argued this entire time is that Sen. Bernie Sanders has a weakness among the party actors (i.e., he doesn\u2019t have any endorsements), and that he has no longtime connections to the Democratic Party (remember, he\u2019s not a Democrat). Biden, on the other hand, has been in major federal office in Washington since 1973. He\u2019s someone who could conceivably reach out to all members of the party. He\u2019s already polling better among African-Americans than Sanders, for instance.\n\nmicah: Let\u2019s break this down a little: Both of you seem to think Biden entering the race is inherently bad for Clinton \u2014 he\u2019d be the most serious competition for the nomination she\u2019s faced. But would there be a couple side benefits, like that by giving the media a horse race to cover, there would be less focus on Clinton\u2019s scandals?\n\nnatesilver: Well, first of all, it\u2019s not just that Biden would be a more formidable competitor to Clinton than Sanders. I don\u2019t know that Biden would be all that great a candidate, in fact. But Biden running would signal that concern about Clinton among Democratic Party elites had gone from the bedwetting stage to something more serious.\n\nmicah: Is bedwetting not serious?\n\nhjenten-heynawl: I mean, it depends how old you are.\n\nnatesilver: But the other big problem (as we and others have pointed out before) is that Biden doesn\u2019t have much rationale to run other than if Clinton has \u201ctrust\u201d/scandal problems. He might never come out and say it, but that would be the whole basis for his campaign. They don\u2019t really differ in any meaningful way on policy.\n\nmicah: But your logic seems circular: \u201cBiden will only enter the race if Clinton is in big trouble, and therefore if Biden enters the race it means Clinton is in trouble.\u201d What if all the party actors are telling Biden that he shouldn\u2019t run, that they\u2019re backing Clinton, and Biden just wants to run? It\u2019s his last chance. And he enters the race.\n\nnatesilver: What I\u2019m saying is that there\u2019s a lot of information we\u2019re not privy to, about what Democratic elites are thinking. Sure, there\u2019s some reporting on it, but a lot of that reporting needs to be looked at skeptically \u2014 like because it relies on anonymous sourcing, or cherry-picked information from a media that would like to make the race seem competitive. The one tangible sign we have about what Democratic elites are thinking \u2014 endorsements \u2014 looks really good for Clinton. But Biden running would be a tangible sign too.\n\nContra Maureen Dowd or whatever, this isn\u2019t necessarily a personal decision for Biden, or at least not entirely one. He\u2019s a party guy. He\u2019s the vice president. He\u2019s not likely to run unless he thinks it\u2019s in Democrats\u2019 best interest.\n\nhjenten-heynawl: Endorsements are merely a proxy for intra-party support. And proxies are wrong from time to time. They\u2019re imperfect. And I don\u2019t buy Biden is desperate to run. He reportedly indicated this week in a phone call with Democratic National Committee members that he and his family are grieving. The man lost his best friend and son. He wants to be there for his family. If I lost my father (my best friend), I don\u2019t take off running for president just because I feel like it. I run because I think I can help my party, and because I think I can win.\n\nnatesilver: Right. It\u2019s possible that Biden assesses the problem and miscalculates. But running for president would be a calculated decision on his behalf.\n\nAnd, by the way, if you read the reporting on Biden carefully, it suggests that the decision is very, very calculated. He\u2019s taking as long as possible to decide whether to enter \u2014 and at a time when it\u2019s already pretty darn late to begin a campaign \u2014 because he wants to collect more information on whether Clinton\u2019s in trouble or not.\n\nhjenten-heynawl: BINGO. He\u2019s meeting with a ton of people who represent different wings of the party, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Richard Trumka (head of the AFL-CIO). He\u2019s doing that, one would think, because he wants to understand what they are seeing. What are their people, their constituents, telling them.\n\nmicah: OK, so let\u2019s say Biden gets in. The night before he announces, he\u2019s sitting with his family and some advisers and they\u2019re talking about why they can beat Clinton (based on everything they hear during these weeks of meetings). What are they saying? Does it all come down to email/scandal? Or would they be pointing to something else in the Clinton campaign or electorate? (I want data.)\n\nnatesilver: If you want data, and Biden\u2019s camp is looking at the same data, then they shouldn\u2019t be running in the first place. Unless they think the scandal will be Clinton\u2019s undoing.\n\nClinton remains extremely popular with Democrats, and that popularity is pretty broad-based. White liberals might not like her as much as white moderates, Hispanics, or African-Americans, but as we\u2019ve argued before, their support for Sanders is more an indication that they like him than that they dislike Clinton.\n\nSome of the reporting around what Biden\u2019s coalition would be doesn\u2019t make any sense. See, for example, from Politico:\n\nBiden\u2019s circle has identified what they see as their potential voting blocs: Reagan Democrats, Jews, an LGBT base that largely credits him with pushing President Barack Obama into supporting gay marriage, and Rust Belt voters. They believe he\u2019ll benefit from better stump skills than any of the other candidates running.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that any of these groups are weaknesses for Clinton. Nor are they all that large, nor do they have very much in common.\n\nmicah: What about the Quinnipiac poll out this week showing Biden running better than Clinton against Republicans in general election matchups? And that voters don\u2019t think Clinton is trustworthy or honest?\n\nnatesilver: I don\u2019t think you can compare a declared candidate in Clinton \u2014 who\u2019s been getting a ton of scrutiny from the press, some deserved and some not \u2014 against a hypothetical candidate who has a halo around him because the press would love to see a huge fight for the nomination.\n\nOver the long run, Clinton\u2019s favorability numbers have been no worse than Biden\u2019s. Often a little better.\n\nhjenten-heynawl: General election polls of candidates who aren\u2019t running in the primary are ridiculous. Once he enters, all of Biden\u2019s faults will be put on the table. And there are a lot to play with. If there weren\u2019t, he\u2019d have done better when he ran in past elections.\n\nmicah: From the WSJ writeup of the Quinnipiac poll:\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll found that 51% of voters have an unfavorable impression of her, her worst score ever on that measure. The poll also found that 61% of voters say she is not honest and trustworthy, another record low. On the honest and trustworthy question, that is up from 57% in a July Quinn"}

As an introvert and hermit, and with what little social skills I possess, the challenge is large.\n\nI had been given a list of names of the women who are Catholic and ambled to each room to introduce myself. Awkwardly I\u2019d pause to greet those in the corridors and sitting areas.\n\nIn the first room, the woman sat on the side of her bed, a wheeled oxygen tank between her knees and tubes under her nose. She was confused by my presence but not my purpose, and accepted my offer to pray with her. She\u2019d scurried to the administrator\u2019s office when I left her room.

I\u2019m not a touchy-feely kind of person and found her advances to hug and touch off-putting. I struggled to hold my ground against the urge to back away. She could not understand that I was offering prayer, telling me instead of her upcoming birthday and of many other happy things.\n\nI knocked on two more doors, shamefully relieved that there were no responses, and headed upstairs. In the stairwell I stopped, overwhelmed.

I wanted to feel that my presence gave validation to Jesus\u2019 love, and to feel pleasing to our Lord. I felt none of this. What I felt was the little love I had was barely enough to keep me moving to the next floor, let alone sufficient to be a presence to these ladies.\n\nLeaning against the banister I steadied my resolve to follow the promptings of the Holy Spirit felt months ago.

He didn\u2019t change the venue of the challenge; he multiplied the bits and pieces that they had to meet the need at hand.\n\nI only have a small amount to share\u2014of confidence, courage, and love. But in the hands of Jesus, what little I have is multiplied enough to feed those standing beside me, and he gives me enough for another day.\n\nThere\u2019s a miracle in here, somewhere.
